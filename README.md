# General Information:

This mod adds base level functionality to several different bookmarks which include:
* Century of Blood
* Aegon's Conquest
* Dance of the Dragons
* The First Blackfyre Rebellion
* War of the Five Kings
* A Clash of Kings
* A Feast for Crows

Certain aspects of the bookmark scenarios(if they didn't already exist in the base AGOT mod, such as the Blackfyre Rebellion or A Clash of Kings) have been added to provide some sort of basis for the bookmark to stand on so it can at least resemble the given scenario.

# Disclaimers:

**This mod will not expand beyond much of what it is now**, it is what it is and you may need to fill in some blanks with your own creative freedom(console commands, cheat menus) if you find that something is missing.
