# General Information:

I am retiring the version of AGOT Bookmarked hosted on Nexus Mods due to a lot of recent corruption issues causing strange issues with the mod. Direct uploads of the files seem to avoid these issues so GitHub will be the only place to download AGOT Bookmarked outside of Steam Workshop from this point forward.

This mod adds base level functionality to several different bookmarks which include:
* Century of Blood
* Aegon's Conquest
* Dance of the Dragons
* The First Blackfyre Rebellion
* War of the Five Kings
* A Clash of Kings
* A Feast for Crows

Certain aspects of the bookmark scenarios(if they didn't already exist in the base AGOT mod, such as the Blackfyre Rebellion or A Clash of Kings) have been added to provide some sort of basis for the bookmark to stand on so it can at least resemble the given scenario.

# Disclaimers:

**This mod will not expand beyond much of what it is now**, it is what it is and you may need to fill in some blanks with your own creative freedom(console commands, cheat menus) if you find that something is missing.

# Installation instructions:

1. Extract the archive into your `C:\Users\username\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod` folder.
2. Open the now extracted `AGOT_Bookmarked-(version_number)` folder to find the `AGOT_Bookmarked.mod` file.
3. Copy & paste the `AGOT_Bookmarked.mod` file into the `C:\Users\username\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod` folder so that you have both a folder named `AGOT_Bookmarked-(version_number)` and the `AGOT_Bookmarked.mod` together.
4. Start the launcher and add AGOT Bookmarked to a playset, select that playset and start the game.
