 agot_bm_8298_desc:0 "Westeros is soon to descend into chaos. After the untimely death of Robert Baratheon, Joffrey, his untested firstborn son, now sits the Iron Throne. Eddard Stark, Lord of the North and Hand of the King, has sent word to Stannis Baratheon that Joffrey is not Robert's son but the result of the incestuous relationship between Queen Cersei and her brother Ser Jaime Lannister. Joffrey, outraged at Lord Eddard's accusations, has had him executed. Now Eddard's son Robb, supported by the Tullys of the Riverlands, has raised his banners and is marching on King's Landing. Meanwhile Lord Balon Greyjoy, ever the opportunist, plans to lay claim to the Seastone Chair and hopes to reave like the Ironborn of old. Finally, across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen, mourning the death of her husband and unborn child, begins her quest to return to Westeros. In this scenario relive the central conflict of 'The Song of Ice and Fire' by George R.R. Martin, but remember: Winter is Coming."
