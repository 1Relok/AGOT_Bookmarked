 bookmark_129_rhaenyra_targaryen_desc:0 "Rhaenyra was the designated heir of her father, King Viserys I Targaryen. This decision had been confirmed by a proclamation of his will. When Viserys died in 129 AC, Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, and Ser Criston Cole, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, defied the king's will and instead crowned Rhaenyra's half-brother, Aegon II. The greens in King's Landing ensured that the news of the Viserys's death did not reach her until Aegon II's coronation had already occurred.\n\nWhen news reached Rhaenyra, she went into early labor, producing a stillborn daughter, Visenya. Rhaenyra blamed this tragedy on those who had stolen her crown. Rhaenyra had a hastily-arranged coronation of her own. Rhaenyra was crowned with her father's crown by her husband and uncle, Prince Daemon Targaryen. When news of her coronation reached King's Landing, she was offered terms to let Rhaenyra and her descendants remain rulers of Dragonstone if she renounced her claims, but she refused. Will Rhaenyra Targaryen take what's rightfully hers?"

Since she was pregnant at Dragonstone when her father died, the greens in King's Landing hid the news of Viserys's death, keeping the king's body in his room for seven days, until their preparations for Aegon's coronation were complete. With the exception of Lord Lyman Beesbury, the small council agreed to crown Aegon.\n\nAegon at first refused to be a part of his mother's plans to crown him, insisting Rhaenyra was heir. However, Ser Criston Cole, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, convinced him that should Rhaenyra take the throne, Aegon and his brothers would be executed. Eustace insists that only this persuaded him to take the crown. Will Aegon Targaryen hold the Iron Throne, or lose it all?"

While Aerys had intended to decline the invitation, the king changed his mind when Lord Tywin advised him to refuse in the strongest possible terms. Eager to demonstrate his ability to handle the situation without the help of his Hand, Aerys decided to settle the issue personally and bring the defiant Lord Darklyn to heel. Aerys traveled to Duskendale taking a small force led by Ser Gwayne Gaunt of the Kingsguard, against Lord Tywin's advice. The invitation proved to be a trap, however, and Aerys walked right into it.
