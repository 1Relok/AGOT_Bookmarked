He massed an army and laid siege to the town in what became known as the Defiance of Duskendale. The situation remained in a stalemate for six months, with Lord Denys threatening to execute the king at the first sign that Tywin intended to storm the town.

While Aerys had intended to decline the invitation, the king changed his mind when Lord Tywin advised him to refuse in the strongest possible terms. Eager to demonstrate his ability to handle the situation without the help of his Hand, Aerys decided to settle the issue personally and bring the defiant Lord Darklyn to heel. Aerys traveled to Duskendale taking a small force led by Ser Gwayne Gaunt of the Kingsguard, against Lord Tywin's advice. The invitation proved to be a trap, however, and Aerys walked right into it. Aerys was taken prisoner, will he escape or perish as a prisoner of war?"
