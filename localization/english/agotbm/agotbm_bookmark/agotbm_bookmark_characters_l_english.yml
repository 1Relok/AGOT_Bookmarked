The Targaryens were far from the most powerful of the dragonlords, and their rivals in Valyria saw their flight as an act of cowardice.

When Viserys died in 129 AC, Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, and Ser Criston Cole, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, defied the king's will and instead crowned Rhaenyra's half-brother, Aegon II. The greens in King's Landing ensured that the news of the Viserys's death did not reach her until Aegon II's coronation had already occurred.\n\nWhen news reached Rhaenyra, she went into early labor, producing a stillborn daughter, Visenya. Rhaenyra blamed this tragedy on those who had stolen her crown. Rhaenyra had a hastily-arranged coronation of her own. Rhaenyra was crowned with her father's crown by her husband and uncle, Prince Daemon Targaryen. When news of her coronation reached King's Landing, she was offered terms to let Rhaenyra and her descendants remain rulers of Dragonstone if she renounced her claims, but she refused. Will Rhaenyra Targaryen take what's rightfully hers?"

With the exception of Lord Lyman Beesbury, the small council agreed to crown Aegon.\n\nAegon at first refused to be a part of his mother's plans to crown him, insisting Rhaenyra was heir. However, Ser Criston Cole, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, convinced him that should Rhaenyra take the throne, Aegon and his brothers would be executed. Eustace insists that only this persuaded him to take the crown. Will Aegon Targaryen hold the Iron Throne, or lose it all?"

The king’s remaining sister-wife Visenya grieves with him, devising ways to keep the House of the Dragon safe from would-be assassins lurking behind every door.\n\n#bold While Visenya considers personal safety, Aegon considers how best to defend their new capital against attack, with the pitiful defenses of the Aegonfort seeming entirely insufficient for the seat of a continent-spanning realm.#!"
