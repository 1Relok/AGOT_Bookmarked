 agot_bm_8277:0 "Defiance of Duskendale"
 agot_bm_8277_desc:0 "The Defiance began in 277 AC when Lord Denys Darklyn ceased to pay his taxes, to demonstrate his anger. Aware of the strained relationship between King Aerys II Targaryen and Lord Tywin Lannister, Denys invited Aerys to come to Duskendale to hear his petition. When Tywin advised him not to go, Aerys, who wished to distance himself from his Hand, decided to deal with the problem personally. Aerys travelled to Duskendale with a small escort led by only one Kingsguard knight, Ser Gwayne Gaunt, to bring the defiant Lord Darklyn to heel. Upon arrival, however, the king was imprisoned. Now Aerys finds himself in a Darklyn jail cell. What will become of the King?"

 agot_bm_8298:0 "War of the Five Kings"
 agot_bm_8298_desc:0 "Westeros is soon to descend into chaos. After the untimely death of Robert Baratheon, Joffrey, his untested firstborn son, now sits the Iron Throne. Eddard Stark, Lord of the North and Hand of the King, has sent word to Stannis Baratheon that Joffrey is not Robert's son but the result of the incestuous relationship between Queen Cersei and her brother Ser Jaime Lannister. Joffrey, outraged at Lord Eddard's accusations, has had him executed. Now Eddard's son Robb, supported by the Tullys of the Riverlands, has raised his banners and is marching on King's Landing. Meanwhile Lord Balon Greyjoy, ever the opportunist, plans to lay claim to the Seastone Chair and hopes to reave like the Ironborn of old. Finally, across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen, mourning the death of her husband and unborn child, begins her quest to return to Westeros. In this scenario relive the central conflict of 'The Song of Ice and Fire' by George R.R. Martin, but remember: Winter is Coming."
